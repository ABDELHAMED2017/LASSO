# LASSO(Convex Optimization Assigment)

Homework 5 for  [Convex Optimization in Autumn 2018](http://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~wenzw/opt-2018-fall.html) lectured by Prof. Zaiwen Wen. Submitted Version.

This repository implements various algorithms to solve LASSO problem via Matlab, including:

- Projection gradient method by reformulating the primal problem as a quadratic program with box constraints 
- Subgradient method for the primal problem 
- Gradient method for the smoothed primal problem 
- Fast gradient method for the smoothed primal problem 
- Proximal gradient method for the primal problem 
- Fast proximal gradient method for the primal problem 
- Augmented Lagrangian method for the dual problem 
- Alternating direction method of multipliers for the dual problem 
- Alternating direction method of multipliers with linearization for the primal problem
- AdaGrad, Adam, RMSProp, Momentum using subgradient
